# Vehicle Counting and Speed Estimation using YOLOv8 and OpenCV

This project involves implementing vehicle detection, counting, and speed estimation using YOLOv8 for object detection and OpenCV for subsequent analysis. The system identifies vehicles in videos, counts them, and estimates their speeds based on their movement.

## Project Overview

- **Vehicle Detection with YOLOv8:**
  - Utilized YOLOv8 for accurate vehicle detection in video streams or recorded videos.
  - Employed pre-trained YOLOv8 weights for object detection of vehicles.

- **Vehicle Counting:**
  - Implemented vehicle counting algorithms based on detected bounding boxes to count the number of vehicles passing through defined regions or frames.

- **Speed Estimation:**
  - Utilized frame timestamps and vehicle tracking information to estimate vehicle speeds based on distance covered and time elapsed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- YOLOv8 framework
- OpenCV library for video processing and analysis
- Input videos for vehicle detection and speed estimation
